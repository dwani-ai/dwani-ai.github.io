Dhwani Workshop - 1st week March 2024

Today, I got 1 month access to a Nvidia T4 instance on HuggingFace. 

For the workshop/hackathon. I will provide API access to ASR/LLM/TTS/Translate services, so that they can directly start with Applications. 
Since the server is self-hosted, we can provide unlimited credits to the registered users.

Those who want to work on server/inference can run the system on on their laptops.

The institute can decide on the theme of the projects.
