System_Ext(TTSService, "TTS Service", "External or custom TTS service")

Rel(WebApp, BackendService, "API calls for script submission, audio generation")
Rel(BackendService, DB, "Persist and retrieve data")
Rel(BackendService, ScriptParser, "Triggers parsing")
Rel(BackendService, TTSServer, "Requests speech generation")
Rel(BackendService, AudioGen, "Selects or requests background sound/music")
Rel(AudioGen, MusicGenerator, "Generates custom music when needed")
Rel(BackendService, AudiobookAssembler, "Assembles final audiobook")
Rel(TTSServer, TTSService, "Uses API for voice synthesis")
Rel(AudioGen, MusicAPI, "Fetches additional music if needed")

Explanation of Changes:
AudioGen Module: Now includes functionality to either select pre-existing music or trigger custom music generation based on scene descriptions or mood.
Music Generator: A new container within Dhwani that specifically handles the generation of custom music tracks. It uses AudioCraft/Magnet or similar technologies to create music tailored to the narrative or specific scenes of the audiobook.
Integration with Music API: Still used for fetching pre-existing tracks when custom generation isn't necessary or to supplement custom tracks.

This architecture allows for a more nuanced integration of music into audiobooks, where music can be both selected from an existing library or generated on the fly to match the story's mood or specific narrative requirements. The backend service coordinates this process, deciding when to use pre-existing music versus generating new tracks.
