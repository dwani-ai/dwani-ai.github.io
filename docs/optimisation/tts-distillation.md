# Guide to Improving Parler-TTS with Kannada Data

## Research Goal
The objective of this task is to enhance the Parler-TTS model by:
1. Improving its performance for Kannada language text-to-speech generation.
2. Distilling the model to create a lightweight version optimized solely for Kannada, reducing memory usage while maintaining quality.

This project combines model training with additional data and optimization techniques, providing hands-on experience in machine learning and natural language processing.

## Overview
Parler-TTS is a text-to-speech model that can be fine-tuned with additional datasets to improve its performance for specific languages. In this task, you will:
- Use an additional Kannada voice dataset to retrain the model.
- Explore model distillation to make it efficient and Kannada-specific.
- Document your process and results.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of Python, PyTorch, and machine learning concepts.
- Access to a GPU-enabled machine (recommended for faster training).
- Familiarity with Git and command-line tools.
- A Kannada voice dataset (e.g., audio files paired with transcriptions). If unavailable, you may need to source or create one (see Step 1).

## Steps to Train and Improve Parler-TTS

### Step 1: Prepare the Kannada Voice Dataset
- **Objective**: Collect or curate a high-quality Kannada voice dataset for training.
- **Actions**:
  1. Identify an existing open-source Kannada speech dataset (e.g., from Indic language repositories or research datasets).
  2. If no dataset is available, record or source Kannada audio samples with corresponding text transcriptions.
  3. Preprocess the dataset:
     - Ensure audio files are in a compatible format (e.g., WAV, 16-bit PCM, 22kHz or 44kHz sample rate).
     - Align audio with text transcriptions and clean the data (remove noise, normalize volume).
     - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 80-10-10 split).
- **Tip**: Check repositories like Hugging Face Datasets or Indic language archives for pre-existing Kannada speech data.

### Step 2: Set Up the Indic-Parler-TTS Repository
- **Objective**: Clone and understand the Indic-Parler-TTS codebase.
- **Actions**:
  1. Visit the [Indic-Parler-TTS repository](https://github.com/example/indic-parler-tts) (replace with the actual URL if available).
  2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/example/indic-parler-tts.git
     cd indic-parler-tts
     ```
  3. Install dependencies:
     - Follow the repository’s README for setup instructions (e.g., `requirements.txt`).
     - Typically, run:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
  4. Explore the repository:
     - Review the documentation and code structure.
     - Identify scripts or configuration files related to training and data loading.
- **Tip**: If the repository lacks Kannada-specific instructions, adapt the existing workflow for Indic languages.

### Step 3: Train Parler-TTS with the Kannada Dataset
- **Objective**: Fine-tune the model using your Kannada voice dataset.
- **Actions**:
  1. Configure the dataset:
     - Update the data loading script or configuration file to point to your Kannada dataset.
     - Ensure text and audio pairs are correctly formatted as required by the model.
  2. Modify hyperparameters (if needed):
     - Adjust learning rate, batch size, or epochs based on your dataset size and hardware.
     - Example config tweak (hypothetical):
       ```yaml
       dataset: "path/to/kannada_dataset"
       language: "kannada"
       epochs: 50
       ```
  3. Start training:
     - Run the training script provided in the repository (e.g., `train.py`).
     - Example command:
       ```bash
       python train.py --config config.yaml
       ```
  4. Monitor training:
     - Check loss metrics and validate model performance on the validation set.
     - Save checkpoints regularly.
- **Tip**: If errors occur, debug by checking data format compatibility or reducing batch size for memory constraints.

### Step 4: Distill the Model for Kannada
- **Objective**: Create a smaller, Kannada-only version of the model with lower memory usage.
- **Actions**:
  1. Research model distillation:
     - Understand the concept (e.g., transferring knowledge from a large “teacher” model to a smaller “student” model).
     - Refer to PyTorch distillation tutorials or papers if needed.
  2. Adapt the model:
     - Modify the architecture to reduce layers or parameters (e.g., smaller hidden size).
     - Focus the model on Kannada by pruning multilingual components (if applicable).
  3. Retrain the distilled model:
     - Use the fine-tuned Parler-TTS as the teacher model.
     - Train the smaller student model on the Kannada dataset, guided by the teacher’s outputs.
  4. Evaluate:
     - Compare the distilled model’s performance (quality, speed, memory usage) against the original.
- **Tip**: Use tools like `torch.distillation` or manually implement a loss function combining teacher predictions and ground truth.

### Step 5: Test and Document Results
- **Objective**: Validate the improved model and summarize your findings.
- **Actions**:
  1. Test the fine-tuned and distilled models:
     - Generate Kannada speech from sample text inputs.
     - Assess audio quality (clarity, naturalness) and memory footprint.
  2. Document your process:
     - Write a report or notebook detailing:
       - Dataset preparation.
       - Training steps and challenges.
       - Distillation approach and results.
       - Performance metrics (e.g., inference time, memory usage, subjective quality).
  3. Suggest improvements:
     - Propose ideas for further optimization or data enhancement.
- **Tip**: Record audio samples before and after improvements for a compelling comparison.
